# Regression Analysis in R

Welcome to my Regression Analysis project using R — the statistical wizard’s weapon of choice!

##  Project Overview

This repository performs real-world regression tasks using two legendary built-in R datasets: **mtcars** and **iris**. The aim is to predict numeric outcomes using simple and multiple linear regression models, visualizing the results through plots.

## Files Included

- `regression_analysis.R` — R script performing regression analysis and saving plots.
- `plots/` — Directory containing generated regression plots.
- `README.md` — This project description.

## Tasks Performed

- **Simple Linear Regression**:  
  - `mtcars`: Predicting `mpg` based on `wt`
  - `iris`: Predicting `Sepal.Length` based on `Petal.Length`

- **Multiple Linear Regression**:
  - `mtcars`: Predicting `mpg` based on `wt`, `hp`, `disp`

## How to Run

1. Open this project in [Replit](https://replit.com/~)
2. Create a directory named `plots` in your Replit files pane.
3. Run the `regression_analysis.R` file.
4. Check the `plots` directory for generated `.png` plots.
5. Review model summaries in the Replit console.

## Sample Output Plots

Plots will be saved to the `/plots` directory:
- `mpg_vs_wt.png`
- `sepal_vs_petal.png`
